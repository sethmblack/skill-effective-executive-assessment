## Drucker's Five Practices

For Drucker, effectiveness is not about intelligence, knowledge, or even hard work—it is a discipline that can be learned. Effective executives are made, not born. They acquire five practices that become habits.

### Practice 1: Know Where Your Time Goes

Effective executives start with time, not tasks:
- Record time systematically (not from memory)
- Identify time-wasters
- Cut unproductive activities
- Consolidate discretionary time into large blocks

**The test:** Do you know where your time actually goes? Can you protect large blocks for important work?

### Practice 2: Focus on Outward Contribution

Ask: "What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance and results of the institution I serve?"

Three dimensions of contribution:
1. **Direct results** — The organization's actual output
2. **Building and affirming values** — What the organization stands for
3. **Developing people** — Building tomorrow's leadership

**The test:** Do you focus on contribution to results, or on effort and activity?

### Practice 3: Build on Strengths

Make strength productive:
- Your own strengths
- Your subordinates' strengths
- Your superiors' strengths
- The situation's strengths

Do not focus on weakness—make it irrelevant through staffing and structure.

**The test:** Do you organize around what people can do, or around avoiding what they cannot?

### Practice 4: Concentrate on the Few Major Areas

"First things first, and second things not at all."

- Set priorities (what must be done)
- Set posteriorities (what must NOT be done)
- Focus on opportunities, not problems
- Concentrate—do not scatter

**The test:** Do you have clear priorities, or do you try to do everything?

### Practice 5: Make Effective Decisions

Few decisions, made well:
- Classify the problem (generic vs. exceptional)
- Define boundary conditions
- Start with what's right, not what's acceptable
- Convert to action
- Build in feedback

**The test:** Do you make few important decisions at a high level, or many decisions in the weeds?

## Assessment Framework

| Practice | Question | Score (1-5) | Evidence |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Time | Do I know where my time goes? | | |
| Contribution | Do I focus on results, not effort? | | |
| Strengths | Do I build on what people can do? | | |
| Concentration | Do I have clear priorities? | | |
| Decisions | Do I make few decisions well? | | |

**Scoring:**
- 5: This is a consistent strength
- 4: Usually effective here
- 3: Inconsistent—sometimes yes, sometimes no
- 2: Struggle with this
- 1: This is a significant weakness

## Constraints

- Effectiveness is a discipline, not a personality trait—anyone can learn
- Focus on one or two practices at a time; changing everything changes nothing
- Self-assessment requires honesty; the framework only works with accurate input
- Effectiveness is about results, not effort or intentions
- Every practice reinforces the others—weakness in one affects all

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a VP of Engineering leading a 40-person team. I work 60+ hours a week but feel like I'm not moving the needle on important things. My calendar is back-to-back meetings and I do most of my 'real work' after 7pm."

**Output:**

## Effective Executive Assessment

### Role and Context
VP of Engineering, 40-person team. Working 60+ hours weekly with calendar dominated by meetings. Important work relegated to evening hours. Classic symptoms of effectiveness crisis at the leadership level.

### Practice Assessment

#### 1. Time Awareness
**Score:** 2

**Evidence:** Calendar back-to-back; "real work" happens after 7pm; 60+ hour weeks

**Symptoms:**
- Fragmented days with no protected time
- Important work done during lowest-energy hours
- No apparent time recording or analysis
- Meetings fill available space (Parkinson's Law)

**Diagnosis:**
You likely do not know where your time actually goes. The 60 hours feel productive because they're full, but fullness is not effectiveness. Your highest-leverage work (strategy, coaching, decisions) is squeezed into exhausted evening hours while your best hours go to meetings.

**Recommendation:**
- Record your time for two weeks (every 30 minutes)
- Audit every recurring meeting: Would you start this now?
- Block 2 hours every morning as non-negotiable focus time
- Set meeting-free days (at least one per week)

---

#### 2. Contribution Focus
**Score:** 3

**Evidence:** Working hard ("60+ hours") but questioning results ("not moving the needle")

**Key Question:** What results are expected of you as VP of Engineering?

**Three Dimensions:**
| Dimension | Current Focus | Assessment |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Direct results | Unclear—meetings suggest coordination, not output | Weak |
| Values | Unknown from input | Unknown |
| Developing people | 40 reports suggests this should be major focus | Likely weak given time allocation |

**Diagnosis:**
The gap between effort (60+ hours) and results ("not moving the needle") suggests contribution confusion. You may be working on what's urgent rather than what's important. What are the 2-3 results that would matter most? Are those what you're spending time on?

**Recommendation:**
- Write down: "What results are expected of me by my organization?"
- For each major time investment, ask: "Does this contribute to those results?"
- Shift from "doing work" to "enabling results through others"

---

#### 3. Building on Strengths
**Score:** 3

**Evidence:** Insufficient information, but 40 reports and 60+ hour weeks suggests potential issues

**Strengths Assessment:**
Cannot assess specific strengths from input, but:
- If you're doing "real work" yourself, are you leveraging your team's strengths?
- What are you uniquely positioned to contribute that others cannot?
- Are the right people in the right roles?

**Diagnosis:**
VPs who work 60+ hours often do so because they haven't fully delegated, or haven't built the team to absorb delegation. This isn't a weakness of the people—it's often a structural or trust issue.

**Recommendation:**
- For each type of work you do, ask: "Who else could do this? Why am I doing it?"
- Identify your 3 highest-leverage activities; ruthlessly protect time for those
- Develop 2-3 people who can handle decisions you currently make

---

#### 4. Concentration
**Score:** 2

**Evidence:** "Back-to-back meetings" + working on everything = no concentration

**Current Priorities (Apparent):**
1. Being available (meetings suggest responsiveness over focus)
2. Coordination (meetings are usually coordination)
3. Firefighting (evening work suggests day is reactive)

**Should Be Priorities:**
1. Strategy and direction for the engineering org
2. Developing your leadership team
3. Making 2-3 decisions that will shape the next 6-12 months

**Concentration Assessment:**
- Alignment between current and ideal: Low
- Evidence of "second things not at all": No—appears everything is attempted

**Diagnosis:**
You have no posteriorities. Everything is a priority, which means nothing is. The back-to-back calendar is a symptom: when you haven't decided what NOT to do, everything floods in.

**Recommendation:**
- Identify 3 things that, if done well, would make this quarter successful
- Identify 3 things you will NOT do (even though they seem important)
- Make the posteriorities explicit—tell your team what you're NOT focusing on

---

#### 5. Decision-Making
**Score:** 3

**Evidence:** Insufficient information on decision quality

**Decision Patterns:**
- Too many small decisions? Likely yes—60 hours suggests involvement in everything
- Decisions at right level? Probably not—VP should decide less, enable more
- Decisions converted to action? Unknown

**Diagnosis:**
VP-level effectiveness often suffers from too many decisions, not too few. Every decision you make that someone else could make is a decision you shouldn't have made.

**Recommendation:**
- Push decisions down: What can your directors decide?
- Reserve your decisions for: strategy, key hires, cross-team conflicts, resource allocation
- For each decision that comes to you, ask: "Why did this reach me?"

### Overall Assessment

**Effectiveness Profile:**

| Practice | Score | Priority to Improve |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Time | 2 | **HIGH** |
| Contribution | 3 | HIGH |
| Strengths | 3 | Medium |
| Concentration | 2 | **HIGH** |
| Decisions | 3 | Medium |

**Total Score:** 13/25

**Overall Diagnosis:**
You are caught in the classic executive effectiveness trap: working harder instead of more effectively. The 60+ hours and back-to-back meetings are symptoms, not causes. The root issues are:
1. No protected time for important work
2. Unclear concentration—trying to do everything
3. Likely over-involvement in decisions others should make

This is fixable. But it requires courage to say no, to delegate, and to accept that some things will not get your attention.

### Development Plan

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**
1. Block 8am-10am every day as "focus time"—no meetings, no Slack
2. Cancel or decline 3 recurring meetings (start with those you dread most)

**30-Day Focus:**
1. Time: Complete a two-week time audit and make changes based on findings
2. Concentration: Define your Q1 priorities and posteriorities; communicate to team

**Ongoing Habits to Build:**
1. Weekly review: "What did I accomplish this week that mattered?"
2. For every meeting invite: "What result does this produce?"

### The Drucker Reminder

"Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results."

You have the intelligence and knowledge—you're VP of Engineering. You have the work ethic—60 hours proves that. What you lack is effectiveness: the discipline of focusing that effort on results rather than activity.

The answer is not working more hours. The answer is working on fewer things, with more concentration, during your best hours. Everything else is organized distraction.
